A principal in SAFE can use permitted **speaksfor** to issue a
certificate of statements on behalf of another. Statements in
such a certificate are normal logical statements, with the only
distinction that the speaker of each statement is defined by the
identity of the speaker subject, rather than the issuer. While Any
principal can issue speakfor statements at any time, an issuer must
get the permission of speaksfor from the speaker subject before its
speaksfor statements become valid.
